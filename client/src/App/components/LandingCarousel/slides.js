// Value Statement just in case you ever need it.
// Music creators can now Connect, Collaborate and Complete songs all in one place.
// The Creative process is individual.
// A finished, produced song is collaborative.
// Both ways, its messy and laborious but The Labz frees them up to do what they are meant to do - create, collaborate and produce great music while we take care of the housekeeping.
